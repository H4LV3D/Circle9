# JavaScript Functions

Function is a block of reusable code that can perform a particular task, it can take in parameters and it's value(argument) also return a value, arrays and objects.

Below are codes examples of how functions are used to perform tasks:

```js {monaco-run}
function greetUser() {
  alert("you are welcome");
}

greetUser();
```

---

## Ways of declaring a function

## 1. Function Declaration:

It is the widely and default way of declaring a function and the exciting thing here is that it can be called before defining it.

```js {monaco-run}
//Remember: The 'name' is a parameter and it accepts a value called argument.
greet("chioma");

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Welcome back ${name}!!`);
}
//Output; Welcome back Chioma!!
```

---

## 2. Functions Expression:

It is defined as a value and assigned to a variable, it can not be called before defining it.

```js
let greet = function (name) {
  console.log(`Welcome back ${name}!!`);
};

greet("chioma"); //Output; Welcome back Chioma!!
```

## 3. Arrow Function:

This was introduced in ES6 and it can be defined without the function keyword and also assigned to a variable and the essential thing is
that the parameters and function body is seperated by "=>". it is very easy, short and handy to code withðŸ˜Š

```js {monaco-run}
let greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Welcome back ${name}!!`);
};

greet("chioma"); //Output; Welcome back Chioma!!
```

---

## Callbacks

A **Callback function** is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action.

The execution may be immediate as in synchronous callback and it might happen later as in asynchronous callback. Callbacks allows you to reuse functions in flexible way.

```js {monaco-run}
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hi " + name);
  callback(); // calling the callback function
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Bye!");
}

greet("Alice", sayBye);
```

Here, sayBye is passed as a callback to greet

# DOM

**DOM** (document object module) is the interface that allows javascript to interact with HTML and CSS.
**DOM** manipulation is the process of changing the structure or content of a web page using javascript or any programming language.

---
# Dom Manipulation

## Searching the DOM 
Using query selector is a common practice in web development.It allows us find an element using it's CSS selector(class or id)

```js
let element = document.querySelector('.people');
// here, we are finding an element with the class name people and assigning it to a variable
```
other ways to search the DOM are getElementById, getElementByClassName, querySelectorAll


## Changing the DOM

### Adding Content
This allows you set the HTML content within an element using innerHTML

```js
let element = document.querySelector('.myElement');
element.innerHTML = '<p>This is an element</p>';
```

### Adding Elements
You can create new elemnts using document.create and add to the DOM using append,appendChild,insertBefore 

```js
let element = document.querySelector('.myElement');
let newElement = document.createElement('div');
newElement.textContent = 'This is a new element';
element.appendChild(newElement);
```

### Removing Elements 
You can remove elements using element.remove()

### Updating Texts
You can update text of an element using the textContent property

# JavaScript Bundlers 101

## What is a Bundler?

A **JavaScript bundler** takes many files and dependencies and combines them into one or a few optimized files that the browser can load efficiently.

## Why Use a Bundler?

- Fewer HTTP requests
- Easier code organization with modules
- Enables modern features like ES Modules, TypeScript, JSX
- Minifies and optimizes your code for production

---

## ES Modules vs CommonJS

### ES Module

```js {monaco-run}
// utils.js
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

// main.js
import { greet } from "./utils.js";
console.log(greet("Alice"));
```

### CommonJS

```js {monaco-run}
// utils.js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
module.exports = { greet };

// main.js
const { greet } = require("./utils.js");
console.log(greet("Bob"));
```

These code snippets demonstrate a common practice in JavaScript for organizing code into separate files and using modules to share functionality.

---

In essence:

`utils.js` creates a reusable function (greet) and makes it available to other files. `main.js` then `imports` this function and uses it to print a greeting. This modular approach helps keep code organized and makes it easier to manage larger projects.

# How Bundlers Work (Simplified)

1. Start from an entry file
2. Build a dependency graph
3. Combine all modules
4. Minify and optimize
5. Output to `/dist` folder

---

# Popular Bundlers

- **Webpack** â€“ Powerful, customizable, but complex
- **Parcel** â€“ Zero config, beginner friendly
- **Vite** â€“ Lightning fast, ESM-based dev server
- **esbuild** â€“ Super fast, minimal setup

---

# Webpack Example

```js {monaco-run}
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js", // where your app starts
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js", // the output bundle file name
    path: __dirname + "/dist", // the output folder (absolute path)
  },
  mode: "development", // or 'production'
};
```

_This is a basic Webpack configuration file_.

---

# Parcel Example

### File: src/utils.js

```js {monaco-run}
export function capitalize(str) {
  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
```

### File: src/greet.js

```js {monaco-run}
import { capitalize } from "./utils.js";
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${capitalize(name)}!`;
}
```

### File: src/index.js

```js {monaco-run}
import { greet } from "./greet.js";
console.log(greet("world"));
```

---

## HTML Entry (index.html)

```html {monaco-run}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parcel App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./dist/bundle.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## Parcel Commands

```bash
npm install --save-dev parcel
npx parcel index.html
```

## Vite Quick Start

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## esbuild Quick Start

```bash
npm install --save-dev esbuild
npx esbuild src/index.js --bundle --minify --outfile=dist/bundle.js
```

---

## Summary

- Use Parcel or Vite for easy, fast setups
- Use Webpack if you need advanced configuration
- Use esbuild for raw speed and simplicity

Happy bundling! ðŸŽ‰
