# JavaScript Functions

Function is a block of reusable code that can perform a particular task, it can take in parameters and it's value(argument) also return a value, arrays and objects.

Below are codes examples of how functions are used to perform tasks:

```js {monaco-run}
function greetUser() {
  alert("you are welcome");
}

greetUser();
```

---

## Ways of declaring a function

## 1. Function Declaration:

It is the widely and default way of declaring a function and the exciting thing here is that it can be called before defining it.

```js {monaco-run}
//Remember: The 'name' is a parameter and it accepts a value called argument.
greet("chioma");

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Welcome back ${name}!!`);
}
//Output; Welcome back Chioma!!
```

---

## 2. Functions Expression:

It is defined as a value and assigned to a variable, it can not be called before defining it.

```js
let greet = function (name) {
  console.log(`Welcome back ${name}!!`);
};

greet("chioma"); //Output; Welcome back Chioma!!
```

## 3. Arrow Function:

This was introduced in ES6 and it can be defined without the function keyword and also assigned to a variable and the essential thing is
that the parameters and function body is seperated by "=>". it is very easy, short and handy to code withðŸ˜Š

```js {monaco-run}
let greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Welcome back ${name}!!`);
};

greet("chioma"); //Output; Welcome back Chioma!!
```

# JavaScript Bundlers 101

## What is a Bundler?

A **JavaScript bundler** takes many files and dependencies and combines them into one or a few optimized files that the browser can load efficiently.

## Why Use a Bundler?

- Fewer HTTP requests
- Easier code organization with modules
- Enables modern features like ES Modules, TypeScript, JSX
- Minifies and optimizes your code for production

---

## ES Modules vs CommonJS

### ES Module

```js
// utils.js
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

// main.js
import { greet } from "./utils.js";
console.log(greet("Alice"));
```

### CommonJS

```js
// utils.js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
module.exports = { greet };

// main.js
const { greet } = require("./utils.js");
console.log(greet("Bob"));
```

These code snippets demonstrate a common practice in JavaScript for organizing code into separate files and using modules to share functionality.

---

In essence:

`utils.js` creates a reusable function (greet) and makes it available to other files. `main.js` then `imports` this function and uses it to print a greeting. This modular approach helps keep code organized and makes it easier to manage larger projects.

# How Bundlers Work (Simplified)

1. Start from an entry file
2. Build a dependency graph
3. Combine all modules
4. Minify and optimize
5. Output to `/dist` folder

---

# Popular Bundlers

- **Webpack** â€“ Powerful, customizable, but complex
- **Parcel** â€“ Zero config, beginner friendly
- **Vite** â€“ Lightning fast, ESM-based dev server
- **esbuild** â€“ Super fast, minimal setup

---

# Webpack Example

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js", // where your app starts
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js", // the output bundle file name
    path: __dirname + "/dist", // the output folder (absolute path)
  },
  mode: "development", // or 'production'
};
```

_This is a basic Webpack configuration file_.

---

# Parcel Example

### File: src/utils.js

```js
export function capitalize(str) {
  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
```

### File: src/greet.js

```js
import { capitalize } from "./utils.js";
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${capitalize(name)}!`;
}
```

### File: src/index.js

```js
import { greet } from "./greet.js";
console.log(greet("world"));
```

---

## HTML Entry (index.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parcel App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./dist/bundle.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## Parcel Commands

```bash
npm install --save-dev parcel
npx parcel index.html
```

## Vite Quick Start

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## esbuild Quick Start

```bash
npm install --save-dev esbuild
npx esbuild src/index.js --bundle --minify --outfile=dist/bundle.js
```

---

## Summary

- Use Parcel or Vite for easy, fast setups
- Use Webpack if you need advanced configuration
- Use esbuild for raw speed and simplicity

Happy bundling! ðŸŽ‰
